#Finecraft

Ever since we saw the Mojang launcher for 1.6.1, we wanted to make a better one. So, that's what we did. From the ground up, we wrote a launcher that updates itself, **and** is pleasing to look at.

**Warning:** The features listed below are for the RELEASE build, and are not functional/existent at the moment.

#Features
With an extensive feature set, you will never need to go back to the ugly Mojang launcher. Please keep in mind that the features marked with (*launcher*) are only supplied with the official Finecraft branch.

**Automatic Launching** (*launcher*)
<br />
Don't want to deal with logging in manually every time? Just select a profile for automatic launching and it will log in and launch Minecraft without you lifting a finger. To disable automatic launching, please use the configuration utility provided with the download.

**Automatic Updates**
<br />
Downloading and manually installing updates is a thing of the past. With the Finecraft bootstrapper, launcher updates will be downloaded with a simple visual GUI.

**Blocked Minecraft** (*launcher*)
<br />
Is Minecraft blocked at your school or work? Is Minecraft not installed already? Finecraft allows you use a SOCKS 4 or SOCKS 5 proxy with little to no effort on your part!

**"Branches"**
<br />
Don't like the launcher provided by us? No problem! The bootstrapper can download launchers made by other people too!

**Isolation Mode** (*launcher*)
<br />
Minecraft takes quite a large portion of system resources, and so does Java's AWT and Swing APIs. With isolation mode, Minecraft launches it its own separate JVM instance and the launcher closes by itself. This frees up resources for the power-hungry Minecraft instance.

**Minecraft Updates** (*launcher*)
<br />
If a new update for Minecraft is found, you will be presented with the option to download it or use the old version. It's just like the old Mojang launcher, just nicer looking!

**News Viewer** (*launcher*)
<br />
View a news page related to your current Minecraft client while you wait for it to download.

**Offline Mode** (*launcher*)
<br />
No internet connection? No problem! Finecraft will let you play without an internet connection!

**Profiles** (*launcher*)
<br />
Do you have multiple Minecraft accounts? Do you hate having to type in the username and password multiple times? Yes? Well, so do we! You can quickly and easily switch minecraft accounts **and even clients** with profiles. If you wish to do so, you can even add an icon to a profile!

**Security** (*launcher*)
<br />
We care about security. Nobody likes having their Minecraft account hijacked and used for griefing. For increased security, your password is encrypted based on your username (but not exactly your username) rather than on the text "passwordfile". Or, if you want super security, you can specify your own custom password (keep in mind that if you lose this password, you lose your profiles). This makes it much harder for a hacker to find your password.
